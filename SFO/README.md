# Air Travel Data Analysis

## Description

The Air Travel Data Analysis project aims to provide comprehensive insights into air travel patterns and trends using a dataset of flights and airport information. This project utilizes data visualization to help stakeholders understand various aspects of air travel, including passenger traffic, flight delays, and airport operations.

## Technologies Used

- **Tableau**: Used for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Tableau Hyper**: Used to store and manage large datasets efficiently.

## Usage

### Details About Use

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed in Microsoft Excel.
    - Key metrics and KPIs are calculated to provide meaningful insights.
